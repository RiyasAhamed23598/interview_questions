Q1. SOLID
SOLID stands for:
S - Single-responsibility Principle (A class should have only one job)
O - Open-closed Principle  (open for extension but closed for modification)
L - Liskov Substitution Principle  (every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class)
I - Interface Segregation Principle (A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle  (Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions)
