 Write a program to implement lazy loading for images on a page, ensuring that images outside the viewport are loaded only when they become visible. 
  import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react'; 
 const LazyImage = ({ src, alt }) => {
 const imgRef = useRef(); 
 const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false); 
 useEffect(() => { 
 const observer = new IntersectionObserver(([entry]) => 
 { 
 if (entry.isIntersecting)
  { 
  setLoaded(true); observer.disconnect(); 
  } }); 
  observer.observe(imgRef.current); 
  return () => observer.disconnect(); }, []); 
  return <img ref={imgRef} src={loaded ? src : ''} alt={alt} />; };
